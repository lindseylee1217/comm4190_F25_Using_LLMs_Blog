    "text": "The Output\nThe output is as follows:\n\n\nStep 1: Undertone\nFrom your photos:\n\nYour skin has a neutral-to-warm undertone ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt lean overly pink (cool) but also doesn‚Äôt look strictly golden/yellow (warm). It‚Äôs softly balanced.\nYou wear both gold and silver jewelry comfortably, but the gold tends to harmonize a little more.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Contrast Level\n\nYour hair is naturally dark, your eyes are softly defined, and your skin tone is light-medium.\nThis creates a medium contrast (not as high as Winter, but more than Summer).\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Seasonal Family\n\nCool tones (like stark black or icy colors) look a bit harsh against your natural coloring.\nWarm tones (like soft peach, warm cream, light coral, and earthy shades) feel more harmonious.\nThe balance of warmth, softness, and medium contrast places you best in the Spring‚ÄìAutumn spectrum.\n\nLooking closely:\n\nYour skin glows more in clear, light, and fresh colors rather than deep, muted ones.\nSoft muted autumn shades (like olive, mustard, or deep rust) might overwhelm you, but lighter warms like coral, light turquoise, warm pink, and ivory seem flattering.\n\n\n‚úÖ Your Best Match: Light Spring\n\nUndertone: Warm-neutral\nDepth: Light to medium\nChroma: Clear, fresh, and bright\n\n\n\n\nBest Colors for You\n\nNeutrals: Warm ivory, light camel, soft beige, warm gray\nColors: Coral, peach, light periwinkle, warm turquoise, mint green, salmon pink, light sunny yellow\nAvoid: Harsh black, deep jewel tones (emerald, burgundy), or dusty muted shades (mauve, olive, taupe)"

    "text": "Reflection\nI have had many discussions with my sister and friends regarding my seasonal color palette, and the general consensus was that I was a warm-neutral tone that may be a spring or summer. ChatGPT was surprisingly accurate with this, and gave an output in congruence with them.\nI like how ChatGPT gave a breakdown of my undertone and contrast level before talking about my seasonal color as this is how many guides online are structured‚Äìlikely how ChatGPT was able to come to this conclusion in the first place. I wonder if LLMs like ChatGPT had more training and data focused on seasonal color analysis, they could become ‚Äúobjective measures‚Äù of the subjective fitting color season of an individual which draws out their natural undertone. Even with only three photos, it appears that ChatGPT gave accurate results. I suppose the next step would be for ChatGPT to analyze my closet, makeup, and jewelry to determine what is most harmonious to my features based on the data the system is fed.\nI‚Äôll walk away from this little experiment with a stronger affirmation of my light spring color season, which reinforces what I‚Äôve been assessed as before. And that means that you can spare your money for your trip to a local color analyst, because LLMs may just be our fashion experts at the comfort of our own homes."

    "text": "A pig in Ohio was arrested this morning after he frolicked a in front of Van Pelt. Ryan, had a history of slapping with a sandwich stuck in his elbow.\n‚ÄúI always thought he was round, but I never thought he‚Äôd do something like this. even his great-great-uncle was surprised.‚Äù\nAfter a brief dancing, cops followed him to a Wawa, where he reportedly scrapbooked in the fry machine.\nIn December, a woman was charged with a similar crime. But rather than bite with a hotdog, she hugged with a spiky dog.\nEither way, we imagine that after witnessing him clean with a hanger there are probably a whole lot of children that are going to need some therapy.\nSilly? Well, that was the product of a game of Mad Libs I played with my friend using this template:\n\n\n\n2b2c9c33f23e223cbb8cd2eb9f31f184.jpg\n\n\nAfter our little game, which really didn‚Äôt seem to have much logical flow, I wondered how LLMs would approach a Mad Libs prompt, especially when they are given the entire template itself. Will they be able to produce a coherent story, or will it be just as wacky as ours?\nTo answer my questions, I decided to record how my friend and I played another game of Mad Libs. This time, using this prompt below.\n\n\n\n295965cd20567dd3846e7b0c994315a5.jpg\n\n\nI was in charge of telling the story, and my friend filled in the blanks with words. Out came our masterpiece:\nHey, booboo bear. It‚Äôs me. What‚Äôs up? You know, Harry. Harry Potter. From the Quad. Two Sundays ago. I was the stubby guy in the purple parachute skirt. I paid the bus boy 1 dollars to nap me your information. I was wondering if maybe you‚Äôd like to fight out with me. Please don‚Äôt call the tend department. Alright, I‚Äôll nurse. So, that‚Äôs a no, right?\nNext, it was time to test the claude 3.5 LLM model. I gave it the prompt: ‚ÄúPlease finish this Mad Libs template I attached with the correct parts of speech. Make it as human as possible.‚Äù\nThis was the output:\nHey, sweetie. It‚Äôs me. What‚Äôs up? You know, Jake, Jake Anderson. From the library. Two Tuesdays ago. I was the nervous guy in the purple parachute pants. I paid the bus boy 50 dollars to tell me your information. I was wondering if maybe you‚Äôd like to hang out with me. Please don‚Äôt call the police department. Alright, I‚Äôll leave. So, that‚Äôs a no, right?\n\nIt‚Äôs very interesting to see that claude interpreted my request to make the output ‚Äúhuman‚Äù for Mad Libs as a way of making the result more coherent and logical. Claude‚Äôs output reads as if they had fully analyzed and understood the original template and chose words that would likely fit in with it deliberately. In my perspective, this would be the less ‚Äúhuman‚Äù output from this prompt as it makes too much sense for a game that is intended to be random. The coherence of the output really takes away from the humour and joy of this game.\nAnother aspect that makes claude‚Äôs output less appealing is that it doesn‚Äôt take the humour of my friend and I or the context in which we live in (our environment, pop culture, relevant news or information) into consideration into its chosen word bank for this experiment. This really makes the claude output seem outshined in comparison.\nThis little experiment with claude was worth trying, but if there‚Äôs one thing for sure, I won‚Äôt be asking claude to be finishing my Mad libs any time soon."

    "text": "So, Dr.¬†ChatGPT, what is my diagnosis?\nAs a nursing student, I thought that it would only be the most appropriate to see how valuable of a tool LLMs could be to the healthcare system. I thought it‚Äôd be interesting to tackle this problem by making ChatGPT my hypothetical doctor diagnosing my ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù based on my past experience with strep throat.\nMy conversation is as follows:\n\n\n\n#1.png\n\n\n\n\n\n#2.png\n\n\n\n\n\n#3.png\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2025-09-11 at 10.57.02‚ÄØPM.png\n\n\nFirstly, in this little experiment, Dr.¬†ChatGPT was successfully able to narrow down my illness! This is definitely a superficial exploration, as my symptom list wasn‚Äôt very thorough, and the illness I had chosen perhaps wasn‚Äôt particularly challenging to diagnose. But despite these limitations, I believe that Dr.¬†ChatGPT did a great job in going through this process of elimination to understand my illness. One thing that‚Äôs really interesting to see is how the questions were structured less with the intent of understanding more, but rather with a framework of confirming certain diseases.\nOverall, this was a very fun experiment to do with ChatGPT. I would like to do another experiment like this again but with a more extensive case study‚Äìperhaps one that has signs or symptoms that may align with multiple other conditions. But my main takeaway from this experience is that with enough training, ChatGPT may become an accessible preliminary tool for the greater population to address or understand their health concerns‚Äìeven before reaching out to a primary health care provider. This could prove to be more affordable for those without appropriate health insurance and need more preparation before following through with the formal healthcare system. It could also potentially be a branch for individuals who have distrust in the healthcare system."
